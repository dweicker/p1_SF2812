\subsection{Problem description}

The problem in the previous section is now to be extended such as to calculate the maximum  available traffic between Berlin and Madrid under the same conditions as in the previous section, ie the capacity limits given in figure 1 as well as 50 Gbit/s of traffic Stockholm-Rome and 40 Gbit/s London-Warsaw. 

\subsection{Mathematical model}
Once again we introduce the set $I$ :
$$I = \{ Sto,Lon,Ber,War,Par,Rom,Mad\}$$
representing the nodes of the system.

The flow from Stockholm to Rome is denoted $k=1$ and the flow from London to Warsaw is $k=2$. Thus, the added flow from Berlin to Rome is $k=3$. The variable $x_{i,j,k}$ represents the flow of traffic type $k$ from node $i$ to node $j$.

As before, the first  group of constraints treats conservation of flow:
$$\sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{i,j,1} - \sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{j,i,1} = a_{i} \quad i \in I$$
$$\sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{i,j,2} - \sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{j,i,2} = b_{i} \quad i \in I$$
$$\sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{i,j,3} - \sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{j,i,3} = q d_{i} \quad i \in I$$
Where $a_i$, $b_i$ and $d_i$ denotes the sources and sinks for each type of traffic and $q$ is the total amount of traffic for $k=3$. $a_i$ and $b_i$ is defined as previously

$$
\text{and } d_{i} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  d_{Sto}\\
  d_{Ber}\\
  d_{War}\\
  d_{Lon}\\
  d_{Par}\\
  d_{Mad}\\
  d_{Rom}
 \end{bmatrix} =
 \begin{bmatrix}
  0\\
  1\\
  0\\
  0\\
  0\\
  -1\\
  0
 \end{bmatrix}
$$



The transmitted data is not to exceed the capacity between each node, which may be modelled as a forth constraint:
$$\sum\limits_{k =1}^3 x_{i,j,k} + \sum\limits_{k =1}^3 x_{j,i,k} \leq c_{i,j} \quad i,j \in I\\$$
where $c_{i,j}$ is the capacity between node $i$ and $j$. The objective function is the variable $q$,, which is to be maximized.


The problem may thus be formulated as
$$
\begin{tabular}{r c l}
		max & $q$\\
		
		s.t. & $\sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{i,j,1} - \sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{j,i,1} = a_{i}$ & $i \in I$\\
		
		& $\sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{i,j,2} - \sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{j,i,2} = b_{i}$ & $i \in I$\\
		
		& $\sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{i,j,3} - \sum\limits_{j \in I} x_{j,i,3} = q d_{i}$ & $i \in I$\\
		
		& $\sum\limits_{k =1}^3 x_{i,j,k} + \sum\limits_{k =1}^3 x_{j,i,k} \leq c_{i,j}$ & $ i,j \in I$\\
		
		& $x_{i,j,k} \geq 0$ & $i,j \in I \quad k \in \{1,2,3\}$
	\end{tabular}
$$
